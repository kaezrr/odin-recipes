# odin-recipes

A short education project I made while learning about HTML from The Odin Project.
<br>
It is a static web page consisting of a few recipes of foods I like.
<br>
The project taught me about HTML images, tables, hyperlinking to other HTML pages as well as how to make proper informative and concise github commits.

cheers!
